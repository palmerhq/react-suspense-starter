# React Suspense Starter

So you can get ahead of it all...


## Getting started

To get started, clone this repository and install the dependencies.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:palmerhq/react-suspense-starter.git
cd react-suspense-starter
yarn
yarn start
```

Open up `localhost:1234` and you are good to go. Unlike the current release of React (16.4), a suspense-enabled build of React and ReactDOM live in the `vendor` directory. These are then aliased with Parcel.
